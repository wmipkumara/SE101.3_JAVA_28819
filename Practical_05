//Exercise 01:
1. There is no difference between declaring the variable with or without the public, static, and final keywords. This is because interface variables are always public, static, and final by default.
2. There is also no difference between declaring the abstract method with or without the abstract keyword. This is because all methods in an interface are abstract by default.
3. Here is the code for the class that implements the interface.

public class InterfaceImplemented implements MyFirstInterface {
  @Override
  public void display() {
    // This will not compile because x is a static variable in the interface
    // and cannot be changed in the implementing class.
    // x = 10;
    System.out.println("The value of x is " + x);
  }
}
